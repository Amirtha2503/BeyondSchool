  <h2>Spark Joy: The KonMari Method for Decluttering</h2>

  <section class="method-step">
    <h3>Step 1: Commit to Tidying Up</h3>
    <p>
      The first step is to make a firm decision to declutter your home. Visualize the joy of a more organized space and commit to the process.
    </p>

  <section class="method-step">
    <h3>Step 2: Tidy by Category, Not Location</h3>
    <p>
      Forget cleaning room by room! Instead, focus on categories like clothes, books, papers, miscellaneous items (komono), and sentimental items. This helps you make consistent decisions based on the "spark joy" principle.
    </p>

  <section class="method-step">
    <h3>Step 3: Take Everything Out</h3>
    <p>
      Gather all items in a category from your entire home and put them in one central location. Seeing the volume you possess helps you make informed decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Does It Spark Joy?</h3>
    <p>
      Pick up each item and hold it. Ask yourself: "Does this spark joy?". If yes, keep it. If not, thank the item and discard it. Be honest and let go of things that don't bring joy.
    </p>

  <section class="method-step">
    <h3>Step 5: Thank The Items That Don't Spark Joy</h3>
    <p>
      Expressing gratitude to objects you're letting go of acknowledges their usefulness and promotes a more mindful approach to decluttering.
