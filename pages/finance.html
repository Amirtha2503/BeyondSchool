      <h3>What is Money?</h3>
      <p>
        Money is something we use to buy things we need and want. It comes in different forms like coins, bills, and even electronic money like credit cards. <br>
        But where does money come from? People work and earn money for their jobs. We can then use this money to buy things or save it for later.

        <h2>Earn, Save, Spend!</h2>
        <p>
          There are three important things we can do with money: earn it, save it, and spend it wisely. Earning money happens when we work or do chores for an allowance. Saving money means keeping it safe for future needs or goals. Spending money involves buying things we need or want. But it's important to spend wisely and not waste money on unnecessary things!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Earning: This could be an allowance for chores or helping parents.</li>
          <li>Saving: Put some money aside in a piggy bank or a savings account.</li>
          <li>Spending: Buy things you need, like clothes or school supplies, but avoid impulse purchases.</li>
        </ul>
